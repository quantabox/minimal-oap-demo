🚀 Minimal OAP Demo - Testing Configuration-Driven Multi-Agent System
================================================================================
🔢 Testing Math Agent (Port 2025)
==================================================

📋 Configuration 1:
   Precision: 3, Show work: True
   Style: detailed, Tools: ['add_numbers', 'square_root']

❓ User: What is 25 + 17?
🤖 Math Agent: The result of 25 + 17 is 42.

Explanation:
- I added the two numbers using the `add_numbers` tool
- 25 + 17 = 42
- This is a straightforward addition problem where we combine the values of both numbers

The answer is 42.

❓ User: Calculate the square root of 144
🤖 Math Agent: The square root of 144 is 12.

Explanation:
- The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number
- In this case, 12 × 12 = 144
- The `square_root` tool confirmed that √144 = 12
- This is a perfect square root, meaning it results in a whole number

To verify:
12 × 12 = 144 ✓

The answer is 12.

📋 Configuration 2:
   Precision: 1, Show work: False
   Style: concise, Tools: ['multiply_numbers', 'power']

❓ User: What is 25 + 17?
🤖 Math Agent: I apologize, but there isn't a specific tool available for addition. I can perform this calculation manually:

25 + 17 = 42

The answer is 42.

❓ User: Calculate the square root of 144
🤖 Math Agent: The square root of 144 is 12.0.

To explain this mathematically:
- √144 = 12
- 12 × 12 = 144
- This means 12 is the number which, when multiplied by itself, equals 144


📝 Testing Text Agent (Port 2026)
==================================================

📋 Configuration:
   Temperature: 0.1, Mode: helpful
   Tools: ['convert_case', 'count_words', 'reverse_text', 'clean_whitespace']

❓ User: Convert this text to uppercase: hello world
🤖 Text Agent: The text has been converted to uppercase. As you can see, "hello world" is now "HELLO WORLD". Is there anything else I can help you with?

❓ User: Count the words in: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
🤖 Text Agent: Here's a breakdown of the text analysis:
- Total Words: 9
- Total Characters (including spaces): 43
- Total Characters (excluding spaces): 35
- Number of Lines: 1

The sentence contains 9 words, which are: The, quick, brown, fox, jumps, over, the, lazy, dog. Is there anything else I can help you with?

❓ User: Reverse this text: Hello OpenAI
🤖 Text Agent: The text has been reversed. 
- Original text: "Hello OpenAI"
- Reversed text: "IAnepO olleH"

As you can see, the characters are now in the opposite order, including the preservation of the original capitalization. Is there anything else I can help you with?

❓ User: Clean up this text:   too    many     spaces   here   
🤖 Text Agent: Here's what the function did:
- Original text: "   too    many     spaces   here   "
- Cleaned text: "too many spaces here"

The `clean_whitespace` function removed:
- Leading and trailing spaces
- Extra spaces between words
- Reduced multiple consecutive spaces to a single space

The result is a neatly formatted text with normalized spacing. Is there anything else I can help you with?
